# challenge2
Professional portfolio - 
The purpose of this challange is to build a personal portfolio to initially display what I've learned and to continually update as I progress through the class.
This exercise is difficult because of the need to build the program from scratch. Key elements of the exercise include proper use of flexbox and css styling. The professional portfolio has links describing who I am, my work product(s), my contact information and my resume.
